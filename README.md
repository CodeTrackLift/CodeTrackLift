Hello!

My name is Pete Chu and I have been a professional in the Pharmaceutical industry for the past 20 years. My technical specialities include Facility Start-up, Equipment and System Validation, as well as Quality Engineering.

I have a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Delaware. My experience includes Validation Consulting with Integrated Project Services (IPS), as well as direct employment with Janssen (formerly Centocor, Johnson & Johnson), and Eisai, Inc. (formerly Morphotek).

With Janssen and Eisai, I was responsible for leading equipment and system qualification efforts as a Senior Validation Engineer. In 2012, I transitioned to a Senior Quality Engineer role within Eisai and was responsible for site metrics, quality dispositions, change controls, and leading investigations. In 2017, I was managing the GMP Document Control and Quality Engineering teams.

In December of 2021, I stumbled upon freeCodeCamp.org and rediscovered my childhood passion of coding and technology. I am currently at the midpoint of my career and have decided to part ways with Eisai in order to pursue a career change that is in line with a personal passion.

I look forward to working with you on this exciting part of my journey!

Best Regards,
Pete
