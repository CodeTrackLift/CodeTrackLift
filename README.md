Hello,

My name is Pete and I grew up in the 90s. I fondly remember multi-sided die, Bulletin Board Systems, Sierra games, and AOL CDs.

'Medicine is my destiny,' or so I was told. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Biological Sciences, and my 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝙸𝚗𝙻𝚒𝚏𝚎 was in the Pharmaceutical Engineering space for over two decades.

At the mid-point of my career, I enrolled in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp to pursue my childhood dream of being a Software Developer.

Please join me, on 𝚖𝚢𝙲𝚘𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐𝙹𝚘𝚞𝚛𝚗𝚎𝚢.
